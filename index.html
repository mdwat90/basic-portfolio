            Hello! My name is Michael David Watson, but I traditionally go by David. I am originally from Athens, AL. I moved to Colorado with my wife from Atlanta, GA in January, 2018. I am a Christian and part-time preacher at the church I attend. I love to mountain bike, play soccer, and just be physically active.

            My passion for coding developed over the course of the last year as I began my interest in web development on the design side of things. I took an online course at General Assembly in UX Design. Since then, I began to build my own portfolio and in that process I developed a passion for writing code. I took another online course through Udemy to learn the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as a little JavaScript. Now, I am fully committed to the development of my skills by completing the University of Denver's Coding Bootcamp and creating a new path for myself in the web development world.
